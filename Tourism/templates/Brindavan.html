                <p>

                        <p>
                            One of the striking features of the Gardens is the works of topiary. The intricately trimmed shrubs take the shape of animals and provide many photo ops for excited visitors, about 2 million of whom visit the gardens every year. Visitors can take walks under the shade of the pergolas, passageways covered by creeper plants and rest under one of the many gazebos that speckle the area.
